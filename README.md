# Robot-to-Human Handover Experiment for Fluent Object Release

Based on the core kinematics/dynamics computation and motion control package (DEPRECATED) [artificial_hands_toolkit](https://github.com/sssa-human-robot-interaction-lab/artificial_hands_toolkit).

This package itself contains modules (ROS Action Servers) to fulfil the different phases of the handover:

  - Calibrate sensors
  - Detect object
  - Grasp object
  - Reach human
  - Object release

It also provides a user interface for conducting experiment sessions, as described on the [project page](https://penzottimattia.github.io/proprioceptive_release/).
